              Welcome to the <br />
              N-Power Programme

            <hr />
            <p>
              Decades of neglect on the right drivers of job creation has left a
              huge number of our youths without the skill, job, or economic
              means to survive. President Muhammadu Buhari's led government is
              making deliberate efforts to address this vacuum through various
              social intervention programmes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The COVID-19 pandemic has unravelled a number of challenges but
              itâ€™s our duty as Government to intervene and support young people
              who are unable to find jobs and accelerate efforts to provide an
              enabling environment for businesses to create sustainable jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Everyone deserves an opportunity to rise no matter their
              circumstance, educational background or belief.

              About 109,823 beneficiaries have gone on to set up businesses
              within their communities as a result of their training and time in
              the N-Power Programme. We are proud of the results so far and look
              forward to impacting even more Nigerians as we commence efforts to
              register a new batch of beneficiaries.

              My team and I at the Ministry are committed to this programme and
              all efforts geared towards supporting the vulnerable. We are
              stronger together and we will make it through these trying times.
